    #
    # ==== Explanation (From Pairtree 0.1 Specification)
    #
    #   Identifier string cleaning
    #
    #   Prior to splitting into character pairs, identifier strings are cleaned in 
    #   two separate steps. One step would be simpler, but pairtree is designed so 
    #   that commonly used characters in reasonably opaque identifiers (e.g., not 
    #   containing natural language words, phrases, or hints) result in reasonably 
    #   short and familiar-looking paths. For completeness, the pairtree  algorithm 
    #   specifies what to do with all possible UTF-8 characters, and relies for this 
    #   on a kind of URL hex-encoding. To avoid conflict with URLs, pairtree 
    #   hex-encoding is introduced with the '^' character instead of '%'.
    #
    #   First, the identifier string is cleaned of characters that are expected to 
    #   occur rarely in object identifiers but that would cause certain known 
    #   problems for file systems. In this step, every UTF-8 octet outside the range 
    #   of visible ASCII (94 characters with hexadecimal codes 21-7e) [ASCII], as 
    #   well as the following visible ASCII characters, must be converted to 
    #   their corresponding 3-character hexadecimal encoding, ^hh, where ^ is a 
    #   circumflex and hh is two hex digits. For example, ' ' (space) is converted 
    #   to ^20 and '*' to ^2a. In the second step, the following single-character to 
    #   single-character conversions must be done. These are characters that occur 
    #   quite commonly in opaque identifiers but present special problems for 
    #   filesystems. This step avoids requiring them to be hex encoded (hence 
    #   expanded to three characters), which keeps the typical ppath reasonably 
    #   short. Here are examples of identifier strings after cleaning and after 
    #   ppath mapping.
    # 
    def self.encode(id)
      #first pass
      first_pass_id = id.gsub(ENCODE_REGEX) { |m| m.bytes.map{|b| "^%02x"%b }.join}
    
      # second pass
      second_pass_id = first_pass_id.split(//).collect { |char| CHAR_ENCODE_CONV[char] || char}.join
    end 

    # Decodes a given +id+ <em>(String)</em>according to the pairtree 0.1 specifiaation.

    #   encode(id)

    #   Pairtree.decode('ark+=13030=xt12t3')
    #   # => ark:/13030/xt12t3

    #
    # ==== Options
    # * <tt>:prefix => Pairtree prefix</tt> - This will remove the prefix from the id
    #   before creating a pairpath.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   Pairtree.id_to_ppath('abcde')
    #   # => ab/cd/e
    #
    # or with the prefix option
    #
    #   Pairtree.id_to_ppath('http://dom.org/abcde', :prefix => 'http://dom.org/')
    #   # => ab/cd/e
    #
    # ==== Explanation (From Pairtree 0.1 Specification) The basic pairtree algorithm
    #
    #   The pairtree algorithm maps an arbitrary UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoded identifier 
    #   string into a filesystem directory path based on successive pairs of 
    #   characters, and also defines the reverse mapping (from pathname to 
    #   identifier).
    #
    #   In this document the word "directory" is used interchangeably with the word 
    #   "folder" and all examples conform to Unix-based filesystem conventions which 
    #   should tranlate easily to Windows conventions after substituting the path 
    #   separator ('\' instead of '/'). Pairtree places no limitations on file and 
    #   pathlengths, so implementors thinking about maximal interoperation may 
    #   wish to consider the issues listed in the Interoperability section of 
    #   this document.
    #
    #   The mapping from identifier string to path has two parts. First, the string 
    #   is cleaned by converting characters that would be illegal or especially 
    #   problemmaticin Unix or Windows filesystems. The cleaned string is then 
    #   split into pairs of characters, each of which becomes a directory name 
    #   in a filesystem path: successive pairs map to successive path components 
    #   until there are no characters left, with the last component being either 
    #   a 1- or 2-character directory name. The resulting path is known as 
    #   a pairpath, or ppath.
    #
    #   abcd	-> ab/cd/ 
    #   abcdefg	-> ab/cd/ef/g/ 
    #   12-986xy4 -> 12/-9/86/xy/4/

    #
    #   ppath_to_id(id, options = {})
    #     # id is a String
    #
    # ==== Options
    # * <tt>:prefix => Pairtree prefix</tt> - This will remove the prefix from the id
    #   before creating a pairpath.
